# Go Pet Clinic

In the Spring Boot world, there is a famous starter project for getting started with Spring Boot known as Pet Clinic.

Pet Clinic is an MVP application that allows you to do simple CRUD operations on pets, their owners, veteranarians, and pet visits.

## Motivation

Pet Clinic is a great CRUD app and easily adaptible to a number of different application styles, from MVC to an API. The best way to learn is by doing and Go has been on my list of things to learn. I decided to port the Pet Clinic project over to Go and build it in the form of a REST API.
